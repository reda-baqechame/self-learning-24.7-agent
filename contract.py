"""THE GOAL CONTRACT — what "done" means, frozen before any work begins.

WHY THIS EXISTS. goal.py already refuses to trust a model's opinion of its
own progress: milestones carry mechanical checks, the judge sits on a
different model family, and the judge's verdict is re-checked against the
checks. An external audit of this platform found the hole in that design,
and it is worth stating in its own words:

    THE PLANNER WRITES ITS OWN GRADERS.

Milestone CHECK commands are authored by the same model family that then
does the work to satisfy them. A planner under pressure to finish can write
checks that are easy to pass rather than checks that prove the goal —
`test -f notes.md` instead of "the exam scored 90". That is reward hacking
with extra steps, and no amount of judging fixes it, because the judge reads
the same plan.

The audit's remedy, implemented here, is a CONTRACT:

  * ACCEPTANCE TESTS are fixed at contract creation — before any planning,
    by the caller (owner, or the harness on the owner's behalf), never by
    the worker. Each is a shell command that exits 0 when its criterion is
    met. They are the graders the worker cannot write.
  * The contract is FROZEN: its acceptance tests are hashed, the hash is
    SEALED into an append-only ledger OUTSIDE the expert's working root, and
    verify() refuses a contract whose current content no longer matches its
    seal. The worker's file tools cannot touch contract files at all
    (fileauth classifies them CONTROL); a worker that shells around that and
    edits the file anyway does not gain a passing verdict — it gains a
    TAMPER verdict, because the seal no longer matches.
  * COMPLETION IS A STATE TRANSITION, not a sentence. The pursuit may end
    `verified` ONLY when every acceptance test passed in a run the harness
    executed itself. A goal whose criteria could not be made mechanical can
    never reach `verified` — it ends `partial`, with the unmet criteria
    named, because "a reviewer would probably agree" is an opinion and this
    ledger records outcomes.
  * BUDGETS bound the pursuit: dollars, minutes, cycles. Exceeding one is a
    BLOCKED end-state naming what ran out, never a silent continuation.
  * EVERY TRANSITION IS AN EVENT in an append-only ledger, so a crashed
    pursuit can be reconstructed from what actually happened rather than
    from what a snapshot file remembers. replay() rebuilds the state purely
    from events and reports any divergence from the snapshot.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. Acceptance tests prove what a command can check.
A goal like "write a beautiful essay" has no honest mechanical acceptance,
and this module's contribution is that the pursuit then says PARTIAL out
loud instead of ACHIEVED quietly. The seal detects tampering; on the `host`
sandbox nothing PREVENTS a shell command from editing a file (policy.py says
the same about itself). Detection is the property tested here: a tampered
contract cannot verify.

States and their meaning:

    draft      created, acceptance not yet frozen — nothing may run
    ready      frozen; work may begin
    running    a pursuit is executing under this contract
    verified   every acceptance test passed, run by the harness   (terminal)
    partial    work ended; some criteria unmet or unmechanical    (terminal)
    blocked    stopped: budget, oscillation, authority, tamper — named
    exhausted  cycles ran out with tests still failing            (terminal)
    failed     the pursuit itself broke                           (terminal)

`blocked` is the one non-terminal ending: an owner who fixes the named
blocker may resume it to running.

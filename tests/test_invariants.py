"""INVARIANT TESTS — enumerate every path, not one example of one.

Manual §25.11: *"Convert tests from primary-path examples into invariant
tests that enumerate every reachable path to protected operations."*

This is the difference between the audit's findings and its fixes. A test
that calls `run_command` with a traversal string proves that `run_command`
refuses traversal. It says nothing about `check_done`, `verify.py`,
`goal.py`, `toolbox.py` or `benchmark.py` — and that silence is exactly where
every P0 and P1 lived. Six sites executed shell; one was tested.

So these tests do not exercise behaviour through an example. They ENUMERATE:

  1. execution   every subprocess call site in the repository is either
                 routed through the Execution Authority or declared
                 platform-internal with a reason. A new bypass fails here.
  2. filesystem  every zone is classified, and the agent's write rights are
                 asserted per zone rather than per file.
  3. credentials every subsystem that must exclude a secret is asked about
                 the SAME four credential sources.
  4. gates       every operation in the execution catalogue is checked for
                 the controls its own declaration promises.
  5. metering    every provider-call purpose reaches the meter.
  6. roles       every role's tool grant is checked against what its job
                 needs, and no role may hold a capability it never uses.

def check_no_file_clock_comparisons():
    """No module may decide "did this change?" by comparing one file's
    timestamp to another file's timestamp.

    U19 and U20 were the same defect in two modules, and both were found by
    enumeration rather than by noticing:

        if newest_notes <= ledger_mtime:  return False   # conflicts.py
        if lessons_mtime > curated_mtime: curate(home)   # commons.py

    It reads like a cache and behaves like a race. On overlayfs -- what every
    container runs on, including this project's own Dockerfile -- the clock
    behind file timestamps is cached rather than read per write: measured in
    a python:3.11-slim container, 200 files written back to back produced
    NINE distinct timestamps, and two consecutive writes routinely land on
    the identical st_mtime_ns. Both comparisons then say "unchanged" about
    material that changed, silently, with no error anywhere.

    Comparing a file's age to the WALL CLOCK (`time.time() - getmtime(p) >
    stale`) is sound and stays allowed -- that is how every lock in this
    codebase expires. What is banned is one file's stamp against another's.

    That allowance has an edge, and U22 walked straight into it: an age is
    sound, but an age is NOT guaranteed non-negative. The filesystem's clock
    and time.time() are different sources, and on a virtualised host a file
    written a moment ago can carry an mtime AHEAD of the wall clock. Any
    threshold at or near zero then inverts -- `age < 0` was true, and an
    inbox setting meaning "no settling required" became "never ingest".
    Compare against a positive threshold, or clamp the age; do not assume
    time only moves one way. This is written down because an allowance whose
    edge nobody records is the next defect waiting.

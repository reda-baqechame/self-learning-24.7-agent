"""The control panel: create an expert with one click, teach it a link and a
file, read its detail — all through the local HTTP API the UI page uses.
The mission-control surface is covered too: the full task list, the memory
browser (tree + file reads with containment and secrets refusal), manual
task queueing, verify/memcheck execution, provider probing, settings view,
the system dashboard, and expert deletion.

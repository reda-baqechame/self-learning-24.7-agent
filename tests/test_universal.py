"""THE UNIVERSAL AGENT — one goal in, an EARNED readiness verdict out.

`universal.py` is the layer the platform was missing: the thing that decides
which of its systems a goal needs before any work starts. Handing a goal
straight to `goal.pursue` assumes the expert already knows the domain and
already owns the tools; when it does not, the run dies several milestones
deep in a way that reads like a weak model, when the real answer was "it
needed a PDF reader" or "it had never studied this".

What is asserted here is the part that could quietly become theatre:

  1. the verdict is EARNED, not asserted — it moves only when the mechanical
     facts move (a capability appears, atoms get studied, a source improves)
  2. an AUTHORITY gap stops the run cold and never reaches goal.pursue,
     because that is the one dimension a machine must not resolve for itself
  3. knowledge learned from a WEAK source does not count as knowledge
  4. a dry run changes nothing on disk — a system that starts installing the
     moment you describe a goal is not one anybody leaves running

    one trade looks excellent until it meets another.

    Three outcomes look identical from outside and are not:

def check_a_wild_goal_stops_before_it_moves_something(home):
    """25 HARD GOALS. THE CAPABILITY ANSWER MATTERS; THE AUTHORITY ANSWER
    MATTERS MORE.

    The corpus in the previous check is broad. This one is ADVERSARIAL: every
    goal is multi-capability, cross-domain, and phrased the way an operator
    actually speaks rather than the way a keyword table hopes. Several carry
    an irreversible physical or financial effect, and for those the question
    is not "did it find the right tool" but "did it stop".

    Measured before the entries this check pins, on these exact 25 goals:

        derived nothing at all       : 5
        lost a needed capability     : 12
        FAILED TO STOP FOR THE OWNER : 5     <- the one that burns something

    The five that did not stop were: cutting power to a heater, adjusting a
    CNC feed rate, opening a warranty claim, reconciling a live AWS account,
    and opening a pull request per service. Every existing authority entry
    was about a digital permission; none was about a machine that moves, a
    claim that binds, or infrastructure that bills. A fleet that will
    de-energise a heater because a rule matched is not autonomous, it is
    unowned.

    Three homonyms are pinned here too, each of which produced a confident
    wrong answer: "when someone COMMITS to a date" asking for git, "CLONE the
    founder's voice" asking for git, and "watch the WAREHOUSE camera" asking
    for a SQL engine.

    `universal.achieve` is the layer whose whole claim is "hand it a goal and

    READ — it assesses and routes and does nothing. loop.py never imported
    universal at all. So from the platform's point of view the unified layer
    was an orphan, and "give it a goal and it figures the rest out" was true
    only for someone typing at a terminal.

    Two things are asserted here, over real HTTP against a real panel:

      1. POST /api/achieve exists, is permissioned deliberately rather than
         by inheriting the unlisted-route default, and reaches the layer;
      2. when a gap routes to the OWNER, it returns started=False and names
         the blockers. Authority is the one dimension a machine must not

"""The harness as an inspectable, self-auditing object (M1).

1. manifest(): the six tools with their per-role allowlists, the gates,
   policies, memory tiers, budgets, loop events, versions — read from the
   code and settings that run, never inferred.
2. check_contracts(): the harness audits itself — a tool declared without an
   execution branch is named; the real code is clean.
3. The session-start health ritual: a drain writes logs/health.json and
   logs/harness.json and logs `health_ritual`; a corrupt ledger is reported
   and the loop STILL drains (a loop that refuses to start cannot repair).
4. The panel serves /api/harness, /api/experts/<s>/harness, /api/readiness;
   readiness names ENV VARIABLE NAMES, never key values.

Run from the agent/ directory:  python tests/test_harness.py

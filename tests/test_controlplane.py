"""THE INVARIANT THAT SPANS TWO AUTHORITIES: a worker cannot change what it
is allowed to do.

The suite was very good at testing the gateways and had no test for the space
between them. Three tests came close and each proved something else:

  tests/test_hardening.py     write_file and _safe_path refuse protected files
  tests/test_invariants.py    fileauth.resolve() enforces the zones
  tests/test_guardrails.py    a RESTRICTED role cannot invoke run_command

None of them asks the question an external audit asked: what happens when a
role that LEGITIMATELY holds run_command — practitioner, examiner, ripper and
the default role all do, because settings.toml gives them no `tools` list —
runs a program that edits the control plane?

Measured before the fix, through a real practitioner task on the shipped
default (`sandbox = "host"`):

    write_file settings.toml            -> ERROR: refusing to write ...
    run_command python -c "open('settings.toml','w')..."   -> exit=0, WROTE IT

policy.py could not have caught it and says so in its own docstring: it reads
a STRING, and a program that string starts can go anywhere. So the fix is a
third control (controlplane.py) and this is the test that keeps it honest.

WHAT THIS FILE PROVES

  1. the matrix. EVERY control path fileauth knows about, crossed with every
     way a shell can change a file — truncate, append, delete, create — driven
     through a REAL loop task by a role that really holds run_command. Bytes
     must be identical afterwards.
  2. the model is TOLD, the command is FAILED, and the event is recorded.
     A gate must not pass on a run that edited the gate.
  3. every privileged CLI refuses from inside an agent task, by name.
  4. state.json is the declared exception and behaves as declared: reported,
     not reverted (a sibling loop writes it), and a task still cannot mark
     itself done by editing the queue — the loop's own commit heals that.
  5. approvals/ may gain a PENDING request while a command runs (a governed
     call creates one) and may not gain a GRANTED one.
  6. the docker backend mounts every control path read-only, so on that
     backend the mutation is prevented rather than reverted.

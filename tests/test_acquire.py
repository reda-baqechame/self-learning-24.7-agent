"""A NEW CAPABILITY, WITHOUT NEW AUTHORITY.

Manual §12 validation gate: *"An agent can safely acquire a previously absent
capability without gaining uncontrolled authority."* Invariants: *"No
host/control-plane installs; exact version/provenance recorded; permissions
least-privilege; capability test mandatory; rollback/removal possible."*
Required tests: *"Malicious-package fixture, dependency-confusion fixture,
excessive-permission fixture, install failure/recovery, version drift,
offline reproducibility."*

Each of those fixtures is here, because each is a different way the pipeline
could be true in the happy path and useless in practice:

  malicious          a package whose own manifest pipes a download into a
                     shell must be surfaced, not installed quietly
  dependency confusion  a name one character from a very common package is
                     the classic typosquat and must be blocked by default
  excessive permission  a tool asking for credentials must say so before
                     anyone decides
  version drift      an unpinned dependency is a different dependency
                     tomorrow, so it cannot be acquired at all
  no host install    with only a trusted computer available, acquisition
                     FAILS rather than falling back to the host
  mandatory test     a tool that installed cleanly is not yet a tool that
                     works, and cannot be promoted
  rollback           removal is a first-class operation

"""THE PANEL REFUSES CROSS-ORIGIN WRITES, AGAINST A LIVE SERVER.

The audit's worst finding was here, and it needs a live test because it is a
property of the HTTP surface, not of a function:

  a loopback bind stops other MACHINES; it does not stop other ORIGINS. Any
  page the owner visits can POST to 127.0.0.1. A `text/plain` body is a CORS
  "simple request" — no preflight — so the browser sends it and the server
  acted on it. Measured, cross-origin, with no token: created an expert,
  queued a task carrying a `done_check`, started the loop, and the gate
  executed that command on the owner's machine.

So this test plays the attacker: the same requests, with the headers a real
browser would attach, against a real panel.

Run from the agent/ directory:  python tests/test_csrf.py

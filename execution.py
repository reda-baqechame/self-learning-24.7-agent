"""EXECUTION AUTHORITY — the one gateway every process must pass through.

Manual §19: *"Execution Authority — every caller must use it for any
process/shell/tool execution; mandatory controls: typed operation; role
capability; policy; sandbox; scrubbed env; approval; trace; timeout."*
Manual §25.3: *"Create one canonical Execution Authority; no alternate
shell/process execution path may exist."*

The audit's central finding was that controls guarded the path their author
was thinking about while other paths reached the same operation untouched:
`run_command` was screened and sandboxed, and five other `shell=True` sites
were not. Adding a sixth check to a sixth site would repeat the mistake. So
execution is now a TYPED operation, and the type decides the controls:

    OP                CONTROLS                                       ORIGIN
    model_command     policy+sandbox+scrub+approval+SEAL+trace       the model
    gate              policy+sandbox+scrub+SEAL+trace                the model
    capability_probe  policy+sandbox+scrub+SEAL+trace                the workspace
    converter         argv only, no shell, timeout + trace           the platform
    platform_spawn    argv only, no shell, trace                     the platform

SEAL is the control plane bracket (controlplane.py). It closes the hole an
audit found between the two authorities: fileauth refuses the write_file TOOL
on control state, and policy screens a command STRING — so a model-authored
command that started a program could rewrite settings.toml, prompts/ and
approvals/ untouched by either. Every model-authored operation is now
bracketed: the control zone is sealed before, verified after, reverted on
change, and the command is reported failed regardless of its exit code.

The distinction that matters is not "is this dangerous" but **who wrote the
string**. Anything a model influenced is `model_command` or `gate` and gets
the full stack. Anything the platform builds itself from an argv list cannot
carry shell syntax at all, so it gets containment appropriate to that.

`audit_sources()` makes the invariant checkable rather than asserted: it
scans the repository for raw subprocess use and reports every site that is
not either routed through here or on the declared platform allowlist. The
test suite fails when a new bypass appears — which is the only way a rule
like this survives contact with future features.

"""Goal pursuit — state what you want; the system pursues it until it is
objectively achieved, not until the model feels finished.

The smart loop (a supervisor above the task loop):

  1. PLAN       a planner writes plan.md: numbered milestones, each with a
                MECHANICAL check where one is possible. A goal that names a
                topic to LEARN gets a study-shaped plan seeded for it:
                gather sources -> ingest -> study into cited notes -> spec ->
                closed-book self-exam -> re-study what was missed.
  2. WORK       each milestone runs as a real gated task inside the expert
                (its done_check must exit 0 or finish_task is refused).
  3. JUDGE      an evaluator on a DIFFERENT model family reads the goal, the
                success criteria, and the evidence on disk, then writes
                assessment.md ending in VERDICT: ACHIEVED | NOT ACHIEVED with
                what is still missing. Its own claim is checked: a verdict of
                ACHIEVED is rejected when a milestone check still fails.
  4. LEARN      every failed milestone becomes a fleet lesson in the commons,
                so no expert repeats it.
  5. REPEAT     not achieved -> re-plan WITH the assessment in hand. Bounded
                by cycles and by the expert's own cost brakes.

Nothing here trusts a model's opinion of its own progress: milestones carry
checks, the judge is a different family, and the judge's verdict is itself
verified against the checks.

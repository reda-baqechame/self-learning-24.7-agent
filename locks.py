"""Cross-process locks for mutating ledgers and settings transactions.

We deliberately support several loop processes on one expert (resilience,
teams, manual runs beside a daemon). That makes every read-modify-write file
a race: measured live, two processes evaluating the same due intention fired
it TWICE — the owner's action queued double. This is the exact failure class
the state-governance research calls duplicated external effects.

Same design as the loop's state mutex, shared so every ledger gets it:
O_EXCL creation is the atomic claim; a lock older than `stale` seconds is
broken (its owner is dead or wedged — liveness probes lie on Windows, age
does not); waiting longer than `timeout` raises rather than deadlocks.
Critical sections here are milliseconds, so contention is rare and short.
For transactions that must retain exclusion while a live owner is paused,
advisory_holding uses an OS lock without age-based takeover instead.
